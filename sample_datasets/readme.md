# Sample Datasets for Rasa NLU
Here are some examples from the [Snips Benchmark Repository](https://github.com/snipsco/nlu-benchmark), converted into the rasa format.

## Converting
If you'd like to try converting them yourself, give this a try!

1\. Check out the `snips-to-rasa.py` file in your favourite editor.

2\. Modify the list, so that python knows that files you want to convert.

3\. Run the script! You'll find that the output files are in the same directory, and each one is named as `{intent}.json`


Please feel free to make contributions to the script, and make it better for everyone! We'd also love it if you decided to add your own datasets here.
