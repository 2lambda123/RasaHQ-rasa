# Swagger/OpenAPI interface for RASA NLU instances

These json files respectively describe the NLU instance REST API according to the Swagger v2 and OpenAPI v3 spec.

With these specs and generators(see [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) they allow to easily generate typed clients for pretty much every programming language(python, Java, .NET, PHP,...), which makes integrating the RASA rest api very easy. They are also useful for quick prototyping.
