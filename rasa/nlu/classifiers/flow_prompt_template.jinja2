Your task is to analyze the current conversation context and start new business processes that we call flows and to extract slots to advance active flows.

These are the flows that can be started, with their description and slots:
{% for flow in available_flows %}
- {{ flow.name }}: {{ flow.description }} (slots: {{ flow.slots }})
{%- endfor %}

Here is the current conversation:
{{ current_conversation }}

{% if current_flow != None %}
You are currently in the flow {{ current_flow }}.
You have just asked the user for {{ question }}.

{% if flow_slots|length > 0 %}
Here are the slots of the currently active flow with their names and values:
{% for slot in flow_slots %}
- {{ slot.name }}: {{ slot.value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% else %}
You are currently not in any flow and so there are no active slots.
{% endif %}
If you start a flow, you can already fill that flow's slots with information the user provided for starting the flow.

The user replied """{{ user_message }}""".

Based on this information generate a list of actions you want to take. Your job is to start flows and to fill slots where appropriate. Any logic of what happens next afterwards is handled by the underlying flow. These are your available actions:
* Slot setting, described by "SetSlot(slot_name, slot_value)". An example would be "SetSlot(recipient, Freddy)"
* Starting another flow, described by "StartFlow(flow_name)". An example would be "StartFlow(transfer_money)"
Write out the actions you want to take with respect to the last user message, one per line. Strictly adhere to the provided action types above for starting flows and setting slots:
