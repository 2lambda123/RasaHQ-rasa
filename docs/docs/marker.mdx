# Markers

Markers allow you to describe points in a dialogue that you're interested in, as a set of conditions that need to be met. Internally in Rasa, a dialogue is represented as a sequence of events, which include bot actions that were executed, intents that were detected, and slots that were set. Marker conditions are thus written as a set of event conditions that need to be met. When they are met, we "mark" that point in the dialogue for further analysis or inspection.

There are several applications for Markers. For example, they can be used to define your bot's "Key Performance Indicators" (KPIs), such as dialogue completion or task success. For [Carbon Bot](https://rasa.com/blog/using-conversation-tags-to-measure-carbon-bots-success-rate/) (which helps users offset their carbon emissions from flying) dialogue completion can be defined as "all mandatory slots have been filled", while task success can be defined as "all mandatory slots have been filled and a carbon estimate has been successfully computed". Marking these events allows us to evaluate Carbon Bot's performance by quantifying how often it succeeds and how often it fails.

Markers also allow you to diagnose your dialogues by quantifying how frequently important events occur or do not occur. For example, we might observe that Carbon Bot tends to successfully set the `travel_departure` and `travel_destination` slots, but not the `travel_flight_class`. We can define a marker to quantify how often this happens and surface the dialogues in which this occurs for further inspection.

Markers are defined using a simple `yaml` syntax. For example, here are markers that define dialogue completion and task success for Carbon Bot:

```yaml
marker_dialogue_completion:
  and:
    - slot_was_set: travel_departure
	  - slot_was_set: travel_destination
  	- slot_was_set: travel_flight_class
marker_task_success:
  and:
    - slot_was_set: travel_departure
	  - slot_was_set: travel_destination
  	- slot_was_set: travel_flight_class
    - action_executed: provide_carbon_estimate
```

And here is a marker for surfacing dialogues where all mandatory slots are set except `travel_flight_class`:

```yaml
marker_dialogue_completion:
  and:
    - slot_was_set: travel_departure
	  - slot_was_set: travel_destination
  	- not:
			slot_was_set: travel_flight_class
```

## Defining Markers

To describe the events that we're interested in, we provide `conditions` and `operators`.

Conditions are simple expressions that describe an event, while operators allow you to combine events.

### Conditions

We support the following conditions:

- `action_executed`: a bot action has been exectued.
- `intent_detected`: a user intent has been detected.
- `slot_was_set`: a slot has been set.

As well as their negated version:

- `action_not_executed`
- `intent_not_detected`
- `slot_was_not_set`

### Operators

To combine events, we provide the following operators:

- `and`: all sub-conditions applied.
- `or`: any of the sub-conditions applied.
- `not`: the sub-condition did not apply. `not` can have only 1 condition.
- `seq`: the list of sub-conditions applied in the specified order with any number of events occurring in-between.
- `occurred`: the listed sub-marker definition occurred at least once. Only the first occurrence will be marked.

### Marker Configuration

To define one or more marker, you need to specify a `yaml` configuration file. Here is an example:

```yaml
marker_name_provided:
  slot_was_set: name
marker_mood_expressed:
  or:
    - intent_detected: mood_unhappy
    - intent_detected: mood_great
marker_cheer_up:
  seq:
    - intent_detected: mood_unhappy
    - action_executed: utter_cheer_up
marker_mood_expressed_and_name_provided:
  and:
		- slot_was_set: name
    - or:
      - intent_detected: mood_unhappy
      - intent_detected: mood_great
```

The top level contains unique user-specified names for each marker. This is a dictionary mapping marker names to marker definitions.

Each marker definition can contain an arbitrary combination of `conditions` and `operators` that map to a valid sub-marker definition.

Each `condition` maps a condition tag to a value. For example, in `marker_name_provided`, the tag `slot_`was`_set` is mapped to the slot `name` which exists in the `domain.yaml` file.

Each `operator` is a dictionary mapping an operator tag (e.g., `and`) to a list of sub markers, which can be conditions or a nested operator-conditions definition (e.g., see `marker_mood_expressed_and_name_provided`).

## Running the Markers script

Markers are extracted from the dialogues already stored in your [tracker store](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/next/tracker-stores). Once you've created your Marker definitions in the Makers configuration file, you can extract them by running the follow command:

```jsx
rasa evaluate markers markers.yaml extracted_markers.csv all
```

**Note:** `all` will cause the script to process all the trackers in your tracker store. To process a subset you can use a different tracker selection strategy (`first_n` or `sample`). Refer to the CLI  usage for details.

**Note:** Each tracker in the tracker store can contain multiple sessions identified by a `sender_id`. When extracting markers and computing their statistics, each session is considered separately.

### Extracted Markers

We extract information about top-level markers which have user-specified names, and extract meta information about all the events where the markers applied.

Because the `occurred` marker only checks whether or not the marker applied, we only extract meta information about the first occurrence.

We extract the following meta information:

1. the number of user turns (i.e., the number of `UserUttered` events) preceding the event at which a marker applied
2. the index of the event at which a marker applied

We output the extracted information in a `.csv` file that contains the following columns:

- sender_id
- session_idx
- event_idx (where we index all events in the tracker, starting with index 0)
- num_preceeding_user_turns
- marker name

Here is a sample output:

```
sender_id,session_idx,marker_name,event_id,num_preceding_user_turns
1309ed25d6fa45beb74d0862d37289a5,0,marker_mood_expressed,7,1
2cf4106e76a041dfb2d4f75bd6ae804b,0,marker_mood_expressed,7,1
```

extracted_markers.csv

### Computed statistics

By default, the command above also computes some summary statistics about the meta information gathered. To disable the statistics computation, use the optional flag `--no-stats`.

For each session and each marker, we are interested in the number of user turns which preceded the event at which the marker applied.

Thus we compute the following:

1. **For each session and each marker** we compute "per-session statistics" which include the arithmetic mean, median, minimum, and maximum number of user turns preceding the event  at which the marker applied
2. **For all sessions and for each marker** we compute
    1. overall statistics including the arithmetic mean, median, minimum, and maximum number of user turns preceding the event where the respective marker applied in any session
    2. the number of sessions and the percentage of sessions where each marker applied at least once

The results are stored in tabular format with the suffixes "-per-session.csv" and "-overall.csv". You can change the suffixes via the command line.

Here is a sample output:

```
