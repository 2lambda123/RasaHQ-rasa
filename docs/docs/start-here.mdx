## Getting Started with Rasa

### Create an initial project

The `init` command creates a new Rasa project for you.

```bash
rasa init
```

Run the `train` command at any time to build an assistant from the current state of your project:

```bash
rasa train
```

While the command is called `rasa train`, model training only happens if you've made changes that would affect your models.

Use the `shell` command talk to your assistant on the command line:

```bash
rasa shell
```

Adding the `debug` flag can be very helpful for understanding everything that's going on:

```bash
rasa shell --debug
```
