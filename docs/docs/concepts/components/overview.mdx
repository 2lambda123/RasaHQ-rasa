You can customise many aspects of how Rasa works by modifying the `config.yml` file. 

A minimal configuration for a [CALM](../../calm.mdx) assistant looks like this:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
recipe: default.v1
language: en
assistant_id: 20230405-114328-tranquil-mustard

pipeline:
  - name: LLMCommandGenerator

policies:
  - name: rasa.core.policies.flow_policy.FlowPolicy
```

:::tip Default Configuration
For backwards compatibility, running `rasa init` will create an NLU-based assistant.
To create a CALM assistant with the right `config.yml`, add the 
additional `--template` argument:

```bash
rasa init --template calm
```

:::

## The recipe, language, and assistant_id keys

The `recipe` key only needs to be modified if you want to use a [custom graph recipe](./graph-recipe.mdx).
The vast majority of projects should use the default value `"default.v1"`. 

The `language` key is a 2-letter ISO code for the language your assistant supports.

The `assistant_id` key should be a unique value and allows you to distinguish multiple
deployed assistants.
This id is added to each event's metadata, together with the model id.
See [event brokers](../../production/event-brokers.mdx) for more information.
Note that if the config file does not include this required key or the placeholder default value 
is not replaced, a random assistant name will be generated and added to the configuration 
every time you run `rasa train`.



## Pipeline 

The `pipeline` key lists the components which will be used to process and understand the messages
that end users send to your assistant. 
In a CALM assistant, the output of your components pipeline is a list of [commands](../dialogue-understanding.mdx).

The main component in your pipeline is the `LLMCommandGenerator`.
Here is what an example configuration looks like:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
pipeline:
  - name: LLMCommandGenerator
    llm:
      model_name: "gpt-4"
      request_timeout: 7
      temperature: 0.0
```

The full set of configurable parameters is listed [here](../dialogue-understanding.mdx).

All components which make use of LLMs have common configuration parameters which are listed [here](./llm-configuration.mdx)


### Combining CALM and NLU-based components

<RasaProLabel />

<RasaProBanner />

Rasa Pro allows you to combine both NLU-based and CALM components in your pipeline. 
See a full list of NLU-based components [here](../../nlu-based-assistants/components.mdx).

## Policies

The `policies` key lists the [dialogue policies](../policies.mdx) your assistant will use 
to progress the conversation. 

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  - name: rasa.core.policies.flow_policy.FlowPolicy
```

The [FlowPolicy](../policies.mdx#flow-policy) currently doesn't have an additional configuration parameters.

### Combining CALM and NLU-based dialogue policies

<RasaProLabel />

<RasaProBanner />

Rasa Pro allows you to use both NLU-based and CALM dialogue policies in your assistant. 
See a full list of NLU-based policies [here](../../nlu-based-assistants/policies.mdx).
