title: Default Actions
abstract: Default actions are actions that are built into the dialogue manager by default. Most of these are automatically predicted based on certain conversation situations. You may want to customize these to personalize your assistant.
---

Each of these actions have a default behavior, described in the sections below.
In order to overwrite this default behavior, write a [custom action](./custom-actions.mdx)
whose `name()` method returns the same name as the default action:

```python
class ActionRestart(Action):

  def name(self) -> Text:
      return "action_restart"

  async def run(
      self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
  ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

      # custom behavior

      return [...]
```

Add this action to the actions section of your domain file so your assistant knows
to use the custom definition instead of the default one:

```yaml-rasa
actions:
  - action_restart
```

:::caution
After adding this action to your domain file, re-train your model with
`rasa train --force`. Otherwise, Rasa won't know you've changed anything
and may skip re-training your dialogue model.

:::

## action_listen

This action is predicted to signal that the assistant should do nothing and wait
for the next user input.

## action_restart

This action resets the whole conversation history, including any slots that were
set during it.

It can be triggered by the user in a conversation by sending a
"/restart" message, if the [RulePolicy](../nlu-based-assistants/rules.mdx) is included in the model configuration.
If you define an `utter_restart` response in your domain, this will be sent to the user as well.

## action_session_start

This action starts a new conversation session, and is executed in the following
situations:

- at the beginning of each new conversation
- after a user was inactive for a period defined by the `session_expiration_time` parameter in the domain's
  [session configuration](./domain.mdx#session-configuration)
- when a user sends a "/session_start" message during a conversation

The action will reset the conversation tracker, but by default will not clear any slots that were set.

### Customization

The default behavior of the session start action is to take all existing slots and to
carry them over into the next session. Let's say you do not want to carry over all
slots, but only a user's name and their phone number. To do that, you'd override the
`action_session_start` with a custom action that might look like this:

```python
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet, SessionStarted, ActionExecuted, EventType


class ActionSessionStart(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_session_start"

    @staticmethod
    def fetch_slots(tracker: Tracker) -> List[EventType]:
        """Collect slots that contain the user's name and phone number."""

        slots = []
        for key in ("name", "phone_number"):
            value = tracker.get_slot(key)
            if value is not None:
                slots.append(SlotSet(key=key, value=value))
        return slots

    async def run(
      self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # the session should begin with a `session_started` event
        events = [SessionStarted()]

        # any slots that should be carried over should come after the
        # `session_started` event
        events.extend(self.fetch_slots(tracker))

        # an `action_listen` should be added at the end as a user message follows
        events.append(ActionExecuted("action_listen"))

        return events
```

If you want to access the metadata which was sent with the user message which triggered
the session start, you can access the special slot `session_started_metadata`:

```python
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import SessionStarted, ActionExecuted


class ActionSessionStart(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_session_start"

    async def run(
      self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        metadata = tracker.get_slot("session_started_metadata")

        # Do something with the metadata
        print(metadata)

        # the session should begin with a `session_started` event and an `action_listen`
        # as a user message follows
        return [SessionStarted(), ActionExecuted("action_listen")]
```

## action_default_fallback

This action undoes the last user-bot interaction and sends the `utter_default` response if it is defined.
It is triggered by low action prediction confidence, if you have this [fallback mechanism](../nlu-based-assistants/fallback-handoff.mdx) enabled.

:::note
If `action_default_fallback` is the next action predicted and executed by the assistant, this will result in a
`UserUtteranceReverted` event which will unset the slots previously filled in the last user turn.

:::

## action_run_slot_rejections

This action runs [slot validation](./flows.mdx#slot-validation) rules written directly in the flows yaml file.
When the assistant asks the user for information in a flow, `action_run_slot_rejections` is executed as a step in the
default flow `pattern_collect_information`. If the action evaluates one of the rules to `True`, then it will reset the
originally requested slot and ask the user for the slot again by dispatching the response indicated in the `utter`
property. If no rule is evaluated to `True`, then the action will retain the original value which filled the slot and
the assistant will continue to the next step in the flow.
