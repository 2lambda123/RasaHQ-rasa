## TrackerActiveLoop Objects

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class TrackerActiveLoop()
```

Dataclass for `DialogueStateTracker.active_loop`.

## EventVerbosity Objects

```python
class EventVerbosity(Enum)
```

Filter on which events to include in tracker dumps.

## AnySlotDict Objects

```python
class AnySlotDict(dict)
```

A slot dictionary that pretends every slot exists, by creating slots on demand.

This only uses the generic slot type! This means certain functionality wont work,
e.g. properly featurizing the slot.

## DialogueStateTracker Objects

```python
class DialogueStateTracker()
```

Maintains the state of a conversation.

The field max_event_history will only give you these last events,
it can be set in the tracker_store

#### from\_dict

```python
@classmethod
def from_dict(
        cls,
        sender_id: Text,
        events_as_dict: List[Dict[Text, Any]],
        slots: Optional[Iterable[Slot]] = None,
        max_event_history: Optional[int] = None) -> "DialogueStateTracker"
```

Create a tracker from dump.

The dump should be an array of dumped events. When restoring
the tracker, these events will be replayed to recreate the state.

#### from\_events

```python
@classmethod
def from_events(cls,
                sender_id: Text,
                evts: List[Event],
                slots: Optional[Iterable[Slot]] = None,
                max_event_history: Optional[int] = None,
                sender_source: Optional[Text] = None,
                domain: Optional[Domain] = None) -> "DialogueStateTracker"
```

Creates tracker from existing events.

**Arguments**:

- `sender_id` - The ID of the conversation.
- `evts` - Existing events which should be applied to the new tracker.
- `slots` - Slots which can be set.
- `max_event_history` - Maximum number of events which should be stored.
- `sender_source` - File source of the messages.

  Instantiated tracker with its state updated according to the given
  events.

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(sender_id: Text,
             slots: Optional[Iterable[Slot]],

             sender_source: Optional[Text] = None,
             is_rule_tracker: bool = False) -> None
```

Initialize the tracker.

A set of events can be stored externally, and we will run through all
of them to get the current state. The tracker will represent all the
information we captured while processing messages of the dialogue.

**Arguments**:

- `state` - The state which should be converted
  

**Returns**:

  hashable form of the state of type `FrozenState`
