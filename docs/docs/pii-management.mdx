:::info New in 3.6

You can now anonymize personally identifiable information (PII) data in your logs and events streamed via Kafka event
broker only. Continue reading to learn how to enable the anonymization of PII data.

:::

Management of sensitive customer data collected by assistants is a critical requirement for complying with regulations
and managing the data securely while making it available for analysis.
Rasa Pro 3.6 introduces the ability to anonymize PII data in your logs and events streamed via the Kafka event broker.
Note that the tracker store continues to store conversation data which is not anonymized because the tracker store data
plays a vital role in the assistant's dialogue management.

## Architecture Overview

The anonymization of the Rasa event is run through an anonymization pipeline at the end of the dialogue management
action prediction and execution. The Rasa agent will invoke the anonymization pipeline during each user message
handling before saving the un-anonymized new events to the tracker store. The anonymization pipeline will first run
through a sequence of anonymization rules that are applied to the new events. Then the pipeline will publish the events to
the Kafka topic that is mapped to the anonymization rule list.

The anonymization pipeline uses [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/text_anonymization/) as both entity analyzer and
anonymizer. Presidio is an open-source library that supports a wide range of entity types and anonymization methods.

### Supported PII entity types

## How to write anonymization rules

You can now write anonymization rules in `endpoints.yml` to explicitly declare which entities should be anonymized.
The anonymization pipeline is configurable via the `anonymization` section in the `endpoints.yml` file.
