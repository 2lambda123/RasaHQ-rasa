abstract: A custom action can run any code you want, including API calls, database queries etc. They can turn on the lights, add an event to a calendar, check a user's bank balance, or anything else you can imagine.

Rasa supports two ways of implementing custom actions, using an action server, or by
importing a Python module accessible from your Rasa installation.


### Using an Action Server

To specify an action server, set its URL under the `action_endpoint` key of `endpoints.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
action_endpoint:
  url: "http://action-server:5055/webhook"
```

For details on how to implement a custom action, see the [SDK documentation](https://rasa.com/docs/action-server/running-action-server).
Any custom action that you want to use in your stories should be added into the
actions section of your [domain](./domain.mdx).


When the dialogue engine predicts a custom action to be executed, it will call
the action server, with the following information:

```json
{
  "next_action": "string",
  "sender_id": "string",
  "tracker": {
    "conversation_id": "default",
    "slots": {},
    "latest_message": {},
    "latest_event_time": 1537645578.314389,
    "followup_action": "string",
    "paused": false,
    "events": [],
    "latest_input_channel": "rest",
    "active_loop": {},
    "latest_action": {},
  },
"domain": {
    "config": {},
    "session_config": {},
    "intents": [],
    "entities": [],
    "slots": {},
    "responses": {},
    "actions": [],
    "forms": {},
    "e2e_actions": []
  },
  "version": "version"
}
```

Your action server should respond with a list of events and responses:

```json
{
  "events": [{}],
  "responses": [{}]
}
```


### Within Rasa itself

Using a dedicated action server is the recommended way to implement custom behavior in Rasa.
However, if your use case is not supported, it is also possible to bundle Rasa actions with
your Rasa installation, by specifying module paths under the `custom_actions` key of `endpoints.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
custom_actions:
  modules:
    - my_module.actions
    - my_module.some_more_actions
```

In this example, all subclasses of [`rasa.core.actions.action.Action`](./reference/rasa/core/actions/action#action-objects)
under the specified paths `my_module.actions` and `my_module.some_more_actions` would be registered.

:::note Resolving action names at execution time
When executing an action, Rasa will first match it against any actions registered using this
method, and _then_ query the action server, if set.
