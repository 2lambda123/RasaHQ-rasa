## Step 1

To use <a className="reference external" href="https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/learn-how-to-export-import-a-watson-assistant-workspace/" target="_blank">exported IBM Watson workspaces</a>
in Rasa. 

## Step 2: Create a Rasa Project

To create a Rasa project, run:

```bash
rasa init
```

This will create a directory called `data`.
Remove the files in this directory, and
move your json file into this directory.

```bash
rm -r data/*
mv /path/to/file.json data/
```

## Step 3: Train your NLU model

To train a model using your Watson data, run:

```bash
rasa train nlu
```

## Step 4: Test your NLU model

Let's see how your NLU model will interpret some test messages.
To start a testing session, run:

```bash
rasa shell nlu
```

This will prompt your for input.
Type a test message and press 'Enter'.
The output of your NLU model will be printed to the screen.
You can keep entering messages and test as many as you like.
Press 'control + C' to quit.
