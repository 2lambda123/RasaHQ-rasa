title: Default Actions
abstract: Default actions are actions that are built into the dialogue manager by default. Most of these are automatically predicted based on certain conversation situations. You may want to customize these to personalize your assistant.
---

In addition to [these actions](../concepts/default-actions.mdx), NLU-based assistants can leverage these actions:

## action_deactivate_loop

This action deactivates the active loop and resets the requested slot. This is used when
[handling conversation repair in forms](../nlu-based-assistants/forms.mdx#writing-stories--rules-for-conversation-repair-cases).

:::note
If you wish to reset all slots, we recommend using a custom action
that returns the [`AllSlotsReset`](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/shared/core/events#allslotsreset-objects) event after form deactivation.
:::

## action_two_stage_fallback

This is a fallback loop that can be used to handle low NLU confidence. Read more about
[handling low NLU confidence](../nlu-based-assistants/fallback-handoff.mdx#nlu-fallback).

## action_default_ask_affirmation

This action is used by the `action_two_stage_fallback` loop. It asks the user to confirm
the intent of their message. This action can be customized to be more personalized
to your specific use case.

## action_default_ask_rephrase

This action is used by the `action_two_stage_fallback` loop if the user denies the
intent `action_default_ask_affirmation` displays. It asks the user to rephrase
their message.

## action_back

This action undoes the last user-bot interaction. It can be triggered by the user
by sending a "/back" message to the assistant if the [RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) is configured.

## Form Action

By default Rasa uses `FormAction` for processing any
[form logic](../nlu-based-assistants/forms.mdx). You can override this default action with a custom action by
adding a custom action with the form's name to the domain.
Overriding the default action for forms should **only** be used during the process of
migrating from Rasa 1.0 to 2.0.

## action_unlikely_intent

Rasa triggers `action_unlikely_intent` via [`UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`](../nlu-based-assistants/policies.mdx#unexpected-intent-policy).
You can control how often this action is predicted by tuning the [`tolerance`](../nlu-based-assistants/policies.mdx#unexpected-intent-policy)
parameter of `UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`.

### Customization

You can customize your assistant's behaviour to configure what should happen once `action_unlikely_intent`
is triggered. For example, as a follow up you can trigger a hand-off to a human agent with a rule:

```yaml
- rule: trigger human handoff with action_unlikely_intent
  steps:
    - action: action_unlikely_intent
    - action: ask_human_handoff
    - intent: affirm
    - action: trigger_human_handoff
```

Alternatively, you can also override it's behaviour as a [`custom action`](../concepts/custom-actions.mdx) by
adding `action_unlikely_intent` to the list of actions in the domain and implementing the custom behaviour:

```python
class ActionUnlikelyIntent(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_unlikely_intent"

    async def run(
        self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # Implement custom logic here
        return []
```

:::note
Since `action_unlikely_intent` can be triggered at any conversation step during inference,
all policies which are trained on only story data, for example - `TEDPolicy`, `UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`,
`MemoizationPolicy` ignore its presence in the tracker when making a prediction. However, `RulePolicy`
takes its presence into account so that [conversation behaviour is customizable](../concepts/default-actions.mdx#customization).

:::

:::note
`action_unlikely_intent` cannot be included in the training stories. It can **only** be added to rules.

## action_extract_slots

This action runs after each user turn, before the next assistant action prediction and execution.
`action_extract_slots` loops through the [slot mappings](./domain.mdx#slot-mappings) of each domain slot in order to set or update
slots throughout the conversation with information extracted from the latest user message.

If `action_extract_slots` finds a [custom slot mapping](./domain.mdx#custom-slot-mappings), it will check first if a custom action was defined in the
mapping via the `action` key and then run it.

After applying all the slot mappings, `action_extract_slots` will run the custom validation action
`action_validate_slot_mappings` if it is present in the domain actions. Otherwise it will immediately return the already
extracted slots.

Note that custom actions used by slot mappings or slot mapping validation should only return events of type `SlotSet` or
`BotUttered`. Events of any other type are not permitted and will be ignored when updating the tracker.

The default action `action_extract_slots` replaces the slot extraction previously executed by `FormAction`.
If you wish to set a slot based on information extracted from intents that trigger forms, you must explicitly specify a
mapping that does not contain the `conditions` key. A slot mapping with `conditions` applies only once the specified form is active.
`action_extract_slots` runs directly after each user message, and thus before the activation of the form.
Therefore a mapping that should apply to user messages that trigger a form must not specify `conditions`, or the form
will re-ask for the slot once it is activated.
