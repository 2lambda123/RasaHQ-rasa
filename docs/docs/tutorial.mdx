You will build an assistant in this tutorial for helping people transfer money. 
This tutorial does not assume and existing knowledge of Rasa or chatbots.
The techniques you will learn in this tutorial are fundamental to building any Rasa bot,
and understanding it will bring you quite far along to mastering Rasa.


## What are you building?

In this tutorial, you will build a robust assistant that can complete a money transfer, and
doesn't get confused as soon as a user says something unexpected. 

Here are some of the conversations your assistant will be able to handle:

<Tabs values={[{"label": "Happy path", "value": "happy-path"}, {"label": "Complete request", "value": "all-upfront"}, {"label": "Change of mind", "value": "change-mind"}, {"label": "Interjection", "value": "interjection"}]}  groupId="example-conversations" defaultValue="happy-path">
  <TabItem value="happy-path">
    <Chat caption="happy path">
    <ChatUserText>I'd like to transfer some money</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>Sure - who are we sending money to?</ChatBotText>
    <ChatUserText>Jen</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>How much would you like to send?</ChatBotText>
    <ChatUserText>$50</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>Just to confirm: you want to send $50 to Jen?</ChatBotText>
    <ChatUserText>yes</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>Ok, it's done!</ChatBotText>
    </Chat>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="all-upfront">
    <Chat caption="All info given">
    <ChatUserText>I want to send $100 to Joe</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>Just to confirm, you want to send $100.00 to Joe Smith?</ChatBotText>
    <ChatUserText>yes.</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>All done. $100.00 has been sent to Joe Smith.</ChatBotText>
    <ChatBotText>Is there anything else I can help you with?</ChatBotText>
    </Chat>
  </TabItem>  
  <TabItem value="change-mind">
    <Chat caption="user changes their mind">
    <ChatUserText>Can you recommend somewhere to eat?</ChatUserText>   
    </Chat>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="interjection">
    <Chat caption="user interjects with a question">  
    </Chat>
  </TabItem>  
</Tabs>

## Setup

If you haven't installed Rasa yet, go to the [installation page](./llms/llm-installation.mdx) and then return here. 
To code along with this tutorial, first create an empty folder for your project, open it in your terminal, and run:

```bash
rasa init --tutorial
```

By default, this tutorial uses the OpenAI API.
If you'd like to use a different LLM, follow the instructions [here](./llms/llm-configuration.mdx#other-llmsembeddings)
To set your OpenAI API key, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="os-dist-api-key" values={[{"label": "Linux/MacOS", "value": "unix"}, {"label": "Windows", "value": "windows"}]} defaultValue="unix">
  <TabItem value="unix">

  ```shell
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

    ```shell
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY <your-api-key>
    ```

    This will apply to future cmd prompt window, so you will need to open a new one to use that variable

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Replacing `<your-api-key>` with the actual API key you obtained from the OpenAI platform.


## Overview

Open up the project folder in your IDE to see the files that make up your new project.
In this tutorial you will primarily work with the following files:

* `data/flows.yml`
* `domain.yml`
* `actions.py`

## Testing your money transfer skill

Train your assistant by running:

```bash
rasa train
```

And start talking to it in the shell by running:

```bash
rasa shell
```

Tell the bot that you'd like to transfer some money to a friend.

## Understanding your money transfer skill.

The file `data/flows.yml` contains the definition of a `flow` called `transfer_money`. 
Let's look at this definition to see what is going on:

```yaml-rasa title="flows.yml"
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: |
      This flow lets users send money to friends
      and family, in US Dollars.
    steps:
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        collect_information: recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        collect_information: amount
        next: "transfer_successful"
      - id: "transfer_successful"
        action: utter_transfer_complete        
```

The two key attributes of the `transfer_money` flow are the `description` and the `steps`.
The `description` is helpful for anyone who inspects your code to understand what is going on.
But it is also used to help decide _when_ to activate this flow. 
If a user says "I need to transfer some money", the description helps Rasa understand that this is the relevant flow.
The `steps` describe the business logic required to do what the user asked for.


There are three steps defined, each with an `id`. 
The `id` can be anything you like, but it's a good idea to use names that make it clear what is going on. 
The first step is a `collect_information` step, which is used to fill a `slot`.
A `collect_information` step sends a message to the user requesting information, and waits for an answer.


## Collecting Information in Slots

`Slots` are a key-value memory store used during a conversation.
Slots are defined in your `domain.yml` file. For example, the definition of your `recipient` slot looks like this:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
slots:
  recipient:
    type: text
    mappings:
      - type: custom
  ...
```

They can be used to store information provided to you by the user or fetched via an API call.
First, you're going to see how to store information provided by the end user in a slot.
To do this, you define a `collect_information` step like the first step in your flow above.

```yaml-rasa title="flows.yml"
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: This flow lets users send money to friends and family.
    steps:
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        // highlight-next-line
        collect_information: recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        collect_information: amount
        next: "transfer_successful"
      - id: "transfer_successful"
        action: utter_transfer_complete        
```

Rasa will look for a  `response` called `utter_ask_recipient` in your domain file and use this to 
phrase the question to the user. 

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_ask_recipient:
    - text: "Who would you like to send money to?"
```

After sending this message, Rasa will wait for a response from the user.
When the user responds, Rasa will try to use their answer to fill the slot `recipient`.
Read about slot validation (link) to learn more about how to run additional checks on slot values.

The diagram below summarizes how slot values are used to collect and store information,
and how they can be used to create branching logic.

  src={useBaseUrl("/img/slots_in_flows.png")} 
/>

## Action Steps

The third `step` in your `transfer_money` flow is not a `collect_information` step but an `action` step.
When you reach an action step in a flow, your assistant will execute the corresponding action and then 
proceed to the next step.
It will not stop to wait for the user's next message. 
For now, this is the final step in the flow, so there is no next step to execute and the flow completes. 

```yaml-rasa title="flows.yml"
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: This flow lets users send money to friends and family.
    steps:
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        collect_information: recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        collect_information: amount
        next: "transfer_successful"
      - id: "transfer_successful"
        // highlight-next-line      
        action: utter_transfer_complete        
```

## Branching Logic

Slots are also used to build branching logic in flows.

You're going to introduce an extra step to your flow, asking the user to confirm the amount 
and the recipient before sending the transfer. 
Since you are asking a yes/no question, you can store the result in a boolean `slot` 
which you will call `final_confirmation`. 

In your domain file, add the definition of the `final_confirmation` slot 
and the corresponding response: `utter_ask_final_confirmation`.

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
slots:
  recipient:
    type: Text
    mappings:
      - type: custom
  ...
  // highlight-start  
  final_confirmation:
    type: bool
    mappings:
      - type: custom
  // highlight-end
```

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_ask_recipient:
    - text: "Who would you like to send money to?"
  ...
  // highlight-start      
  utter_ask_final_confirmation:
    - text: "Please confirm: you want to transfer {amount} to {recipient}?"
  // highlight-end    
```

Notice that your confirmation question uses curly brackets `{}` to include slot values in your response. 

Add a `collect_information` step to your flow and give it the id `confirm_transfer`.
Also change the `next` attribute of the `ask_amount` step to match the `id` of your newly created step: `confirm_transfer`.


```yaml-rasa title="flows.yml"
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: This flow lets users send money to friends and family.
    steps:
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        collect_information: recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        collect_information: amount
        // highlight-start           
        next: "confirm_transfer"
      - id: "confirm_transfer"
        collect_information: final_confirmation
        next:
          - if: final_confirmation
            then: "transfer_successful"        
        // highlight-end
      - id: "transfer_successful"
        action: utter_transfer_complete

```

The `next` attribute of your `confirm_transfer` step includes a `condition`.
The expression after the `if:` key will be evaluated and return `True` or `False`.
In this case, we're using the value of the boolean slot `final_confirmation`. 
Conditions can be used to create branching logic, including logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, etc.
You can learn more about conditions and advanced logic here (link). 

To try out the updated version of your assistant, run `rasa train`, and then `rasa shell` to talk to your bot.
It should now ask you to confirm before completing the transfer. 


## Integrating an API call

An `action` step in a flow can describe two types of actions.
If the name of the action starts with `utter_`, then this action sends a message to the user.
The name of the action has to match the name of one of the `responses` defined in your domain.
The final step in your flow contains the action `utter_transfer_complete`, and this response is 
also defined in your domain. Responses can contain buttons, images, and custom payloads. 
You can learn more about everything you can do with responses here (link). 

The second type of `action` is a custom action. The name of a custom action starts with `action_`. 

You are going to create a custom action, `action_check_balance`, to check whether the user has enough money
to make the transfer, and then add logic to your flow to handle both cases.

Your custom action is defined in the file `actions.py`.
To learn more about custom actions, go here (link). 

Your `actions.py` file should look like this:

```python title="actions.py"
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet

class ActionSufficientBalance(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_sufficient_balance"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        balance = 1000 # hard-coded for tutorial purposes
        # a real api call would look something like
        # result = requests.get("https://example.com/api/balance")
        # balance = result.json()["balance"]
        transfer_amount = tracker.get_slot("amount")
        has_sufficient_funds = transfer_amount <= balance
        return [SlotSet("has_sufficient_funds", has_sufficient_funds)]
```

Slots are the primary way to pass information to and from custom actions.
In the `run()` method above, you access the value of the `amount` slot that was set during the conversation,
and you pass information back to the conversation by returning a `SlotSet` event to update the `has_sufficient_funds` slot.


<img alt="diagram of how slots are used with custom actions" src={useBaseUrl("/img/slot-communication-customaction.png")} />


Now you are going to make three additions to your `domain.yml`.
You will add a top-level section listing your custom actions. 
You will add the new boolean slot `has_sufficient_funds`, and you will
add a new response to send to the user in case they do not have sufficient funds. 

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
// highlight-start
actions:
  - action_sufficient_funds
// highlight-end

slots:
  ...
  // highlight-start
  has_sufficient_funds:
    type: bool
    mappings:
      - type: custom
  // highlight-end

responses:
  ...
  // highlight-start
  utter_insufficient_funds:
    text: "You do not have enough funds to make this transaction."
  // highlight-end
```

Now you are going to update your flow logic to handle the cases where the user does or does not have
 enough money in their account to make the transfer. 

```yaml-rasa title="flows.yml"
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: This flow lets users send money to friends and family.
    steps:
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        collect_information: recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        collect_information: amount
        // highlight-start
        next: "check_funds"
      - id: "check_funds"
        action: action_sufficient_funds
        next:
          - if: has_sufficient_funds
            then: "confirm_transfer"
          - else: "insufficient_funds"
      - id: "insufficient_funds"
        action: utter_insufficient_funds      
        // highlight-end      
      - id: "confirm_transfer"
        collect_information: final_confirmation
        next:
          - if: final_confirmation
            then: "transfer_successful"
          - else: "transfer_cancelled"
      - id: "transfer_cancelled"
        action: utter_transfer_cancelled
      - id: "transfer_successful"
        action: utter_transfer_complete
```

## Testing your Custom Action

Custom actions are run as a separate server to the main Rasa assistant. 
To start your custom action server, create a new terminal tab and run:

```
rasa run actions
```

Double check that in the file `endpoints.yml`, that the section for your custom action server is uncommented:

```yaml title="endpoints.yml"
action_endpoint:
  url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook"
```

Then re-start your bot by running `rasa shell`.
When you reach the `"check_funds"` step in your flow, Rasa will call the custom action `action_sufficient_funds`.
We have hardcoded the user's balance to be `1000`, so if you try to send more, the assistant will tell you that
you don't have enough funds in your account. 

At this point you have experience using some of the key concepts involved in building with Rasa.
Congratulations! Take some time to look over these more advanced topics to learn even more.
