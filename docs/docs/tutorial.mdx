You will build an assistant in this tutorial for helping people transfer money. 
This tutorial does not assume and existing knowledge of Rasa or chatbots.
The techniques you will learn in this tutorial are fundamental to building any Rasa bot,
and understanding it will bring you quite far along to mastering Rasa.


## What are you building?

In this tutorial, you will build a robust assistant that can complete a money transfer, and
doesn't get confused as soon as a user says something unexpected. 

Here are some of the conversations your assistant will be able to handle:

<Tabs values={[{"label": "Happy path", "value": "happy-path"}, {"label": "Complete request", "value": "all-upfront"}, {"label": "Change of mind", "value": "change-mind"}, {"label": "Interjection", "value": "interjection"}]}  groupId="example-conversations" defaultValue="happy-path">
  <TabItem value="happy-path">
    <Chat caption="happy path">
    <ChatUserText>I'd like to transfer some money</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>Sure - who are we sending money to?</ChatBotText>
    </Chat>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="all-upfront">
    <Chat caption="All info given">
    <ChatUserText>I want to send $100 to Joe</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>Just to confirm, you want to send $100.00 to Joe Smith?</ChatBotText>
    <ChatUserText>yes.</ChatUserText>
    <ChatBotText>All done. $100.00 has been sent to Joe Smith.</ChatBotText>
    <ChatBotText>Is there anything else I can help you with?</ChatBotText>
    </Chat>
  </TabItem>  
  <TabItem value="change-mind">
    <Chat caption="user changes their mind">
    <ChatUserText>Can you recommend somewhere to eat?</ChatUserText>   
    </Chat>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="interjection">
    <Chat caption="user interjects with a question">  
    </Chat>
  </TabItem>  
</Tabs>

## Setup

If you haven't installed Rasa yet, go to the installation page (link) and then return here. 
To code along with this tutorial, first create an empty folder for your project, open it in your terminal, and run:

```bash
rasa init --tutorial
```

## Overview

Open up the project folder in your IDE to see the files that make up your new project.
In this tutorial you will primarily work with the following files:

* `data/flows.yml` 
* `domain.yml`
* `actions/actions.py`

## Testing your money transfer skill

Train your assistant by running:

```bash
rasa train
```

And start talking to it in the shell by running:

```bash
rasa shell
```

Tell the bot that you'd like to transfer some money to a friend.

## Understanding your money transfer skill.

The file `data/flows.yml` contains the definition of a `flow` called `transfer_money`. 
Let's look at this definition to see what is going on:

```yaml
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: This flow lets users send money to friends and family.
    steps:
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        collect_information: recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        collect_information: amount_of_money
        next: "utter_transfer_complete"
      - id: "transfer_successful"
        action: utter_transfer_complete        
```

The two key attributes of the `transfer_money` flow are the `description` and the `steps`.
The `description` is helpful for anyone who inspects your code to understand what is going on.
But it is also used to help decide _when_ to activate this flow. 
If a user says "I need to transfer some money", the description helps Rasa understand that this is the relevant flow.
The `steps` describe the business logic required to do what the user asked for.


There are three steps defined, each with an `id`. 
The `id` can be anything you like, but it's a good idea to use names that make it clear what is going on. 
The first step is a `collect_information` step, which is used to fill a `slot`.
`Slots` are a key-value memory store used during a conversation. 
A `collect_information` step sends a message to the user requesting information, and waits for an answer.

The syntax `collect_information: transfer_money_recipient` means that when the user answers, Rasa will try to use
their answer to fill the slot `transfer_money_recipient`.
It also means that Rasa will look for a `response` called `utter_ask_transfer_money_recipient`.


The slot `recipient` and the phrasing of the question `utter_ask_recipient` are both defined
in your domain file. The corresponding part of your domain file looks like this:

```yaml
slots:
  recipient:
  type: Text
  mappings:
    - type: custom

responses:
  utter_ask_recipient:
    - text: "Who would you like to send money to?"
```

The third `step` in your `transfer_money` flow is not a `collect_information` step but an `action` step.
This means that your assistant will execute the corresponding action and then proceed.
It will not stop to wait for the user's next message. 
For now, this is the final step in the flow, so there is no next step to execute and the flow completes. 

## Adding a Confirmation Step

You're going to introduce an extra step, asking the user to confirm the amount and the recipient before 
sending the transfer. 
This also shows you how you can create branching logic based on what the user says. 
You are asking a yes/no question, so you can store the result in a boolean `slot`.

In your domain file, add the definition of this slot and the corresponding response:

```yaml
slots:
  recipient:
  type: Text
  mappings:
    - type: custom
  // highlight-start  
  final_confirmation:
  type: bool
  mappings:
    - type: custom
  // highlight-end
```

```yaml
responses:
  utter_ask_recipient:
    - text: "Who would you like to send money to?"
  // highlight-start      
  utter_ask_final_confirmation:
    - text: "Please confirm: you want to transfer {amount} to {recipient}?"
  // highlight-end    
```

Notice that your confirmation question uses curly brackets `{}` to include slot values in your response. 

Add a `collect_information` step to your flow, and change the `next` attribute of the `ask_amount` step to 
match the `id` of your newly created step.

```yaml
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: This flow lets users send money to friends and family.
    steps:
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        collect_information: recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        collect_information: amount_of_money
        // highlight-start           
        next: "confirm_transfer"
      - id: "confirm_transfer"
        collect_information: final_confirmation
        next:
          - if: final_confirmation
            then: "transfer_successful"
        // highlight-end
      - id: "transfer_successful"
        action: utter_transfer_complete
```

The `next` attribute of your `confirm_transfer` step includes a `condition`.
The expression after the `if:` key will be evaluated and return `True` or `False`.
In this case, we're using the value of the boolean slot `final_confirmation`. 
Conditions can be used to create branching logic, including logical operators like `and`, `or`, etc.
Learn more about conditions here (link). 

To try out the updated version of your assistant, run `rasa train`, and then `rasa shell` to talk to your bot.

## Contextual rephrasing

So far your assistant only uses templated responses. 
You can also allow Rasa to dynamically rephrase these, taking the context of the conversation into account.
To do this, add `rephrase: true` metadata to some of the responses in your domain:

```yaml
responses:
  utter_ask_recipient:
    - text: "Who would you like to send money to?"
  // highlight-start    
      metadata:
        rephrase: true    
  // highlight-end
  utter_ask_final_confirmation:
    - text: "Please confirm: you want to transfer {amount} to {recipient}?"
```

Re-run `rasa train` and then `rasa shell` again to try your updated assistant.

## Integrating an API call

An `action` step in a flow can describe two types of actions.
If the name of the action starts with `utter_`, then this action sends a message to the user.
The name of the action has to match the name of one of the `responses` defined in your domain.
The final step in your flow contains the action `utter_transfer_complete`, and this response is 
also defined in your domain. Responses can contain buttons, images, and custom payloads. 
You can learn more about everything you can do with responses here (link). 

The second type of `action` is a custom action. The name of a custom action starts with `action_`. 

You are going to create a custom action, `action_check_balance`, to check whether the user has enough money
to make the transfer, and then add logic to your flow to handle both cases.

You are going to create your custom action by editing the `actions/actions.py` file.
To learn more about custom actions, including how to build custom actions in languages other than python, go here (link). 

Uncomment the import statements at the top of your `actions/actions.py` file, and add the following: 

```python
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet

class ActionSufficientBalance(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_sufficient_balance"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        balance = 1000 # hard-coded for tutorial purposes
        # a real api call would look something like
        # result = requests.get("https://example.com/api/balance")
        # balance = result.json()["balance"]
        transfer_amount = tracker.get_slot("amount")
        has_sufficient_funds = transfer_amount < balance
        return [SlotSet("has_sufficient_funds", has_sufficient_funds)]
```

Slots are the primary way to pass information to and from custom actions.
In the `run()` method above, you access the value of the `amount` slot that was set during the conversation,
and you pass information back to the conversation by returning a `SlotSet` event.

Now add the action and the corresponding slot following to your `domain.yml`, so that your assistant knows it can use this action:

```yaml
actions:
  - action_sufficient_balance

slots:
  - has_sufficient_funds:
    type: bool
    mappings:
      - type: custom
```

Now you are going to update your flow logic to handle the cases where the user does or does not have
 enough money in their account to make the transfer. 

```yaml
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: This flow lets users send money to friends and family.
    steps:
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        collect_information: recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        collect_information: amount_of_money
        // highlight-start        
        next: "check_balance"
      - id: "check_balance"
        action: check_balance
        next:
          - if: has_sufficient_funds
            then: "confirm_transfer"
          - else: "insufficient_funds"
      - id: "insufficient_funds"
        action: utter_transfer_money_insufficient_funds      
        // highlight-end      
      - id: "confirm_transfer"
        collect_information: final_confirmation
        next:
          - if: final_confirmation
            then: "transfer_successful"

      - id: "transfer_successful"
        action: utter_transfer_complete
```
