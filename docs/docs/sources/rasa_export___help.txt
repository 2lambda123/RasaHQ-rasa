optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --endpoints ENDPOINTS
                        Endpoint configuration file specifying the tracker
                        store and event broker. (default: endpoints.yml)
  --minimum-timestamp MINIMUM_TIMESTAMP
                        Minimum timestamp of events to be exported. The
                        constraint is applied in a 'greater than or equal'
                        comparison. (default: None)
  --maximum-timestamp MAXIMUM_TIMESTAMP
                        Maximum timestamp of events to be exported. The
                        constraint is applied in a 'less than' comparison.
                        (default: None)
  --offset-timestamps-by-seconds OFFSET_TIMESTAMPS_BY_SECONDS
                        Offset all event timestamps by the specified amount of
                        seconds. This won't modify the stored events in the
                        tracker store, but only change the timestamps in the
                        events exported to the broker. (default: None)
  --conversation-ids CONVERSATION_IDS
                        Comma-separated list of conversation IDs to migrate.
                        If unset, all available conversation IDs will be
                        exported. (default: None)

Python Logging Options:
  You can control level of log messages printed. In addition to these
  arguments, a more fine grained configuration can be achieved with
  environment variables. See online documentation for more info.

  -v, --verbose         Be verbose. Sets logging level to INFO. (default:
                        None)
  -vv, --debug          Print lots of debugging statements. Sets logging level
                        to DEBUG. (default: None)
  --quiet               Be quiet! Sets logging level to WARNING. (default:
                        None)
  --logging-config-file LOGGING_CONFIG_FILE
                        If set, the name of the logging configuration file
                        will be set to the given name. (default: None)
