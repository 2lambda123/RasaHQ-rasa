The Flow Policy in Rasa is a state machine that enables you to
manage conversational flows in your chatbot and combine your business logic 
with machine learning. 

The policy manages the state of your bot, transitioning between states, and
initiating new flows when required. The "Flow Stack" represents 
all flows that have been started and not yet completed and reference steps
defined using the [flows specification](../flows.mdx).

The policy allows you to express your logic in flows, shaping the way a conversation 
progresses based on user input and system response. Other classifiers will
modify the underlying state machine to handle edge-cases. 

Please refer to the [flows specification](../flows.mdx) for detailed 
information on defining flows.

## Adding the FlowPolicy to your bot

Incorporating the FlowPolicy into your bot involves a two-step process. First,
you need to configure the FlowPolicy in your 'config.yml' file. The
configuration ensures that your bot recognizes and applies the `FlowPolicy` when
running:
    
```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
# - ...
  - name: rasa.core.policies.flow_policy.FlowPolicy
# - ...
```

Second, you need to add flows to your bot in accordance with the [flows
specification](../flows.mdx). This step involves defining the states and transitions your bot
should recognize and respond to.

Once added, the `FlowPolicy` will read all defined flows from your training data
and apply them.

## How does it work?

The FlowPolicy works by managing the state of your bot, transitioning between
states, and initiating new flows when required.

### Managing the State

The state of your bot is managed using a 'flow stack'. The flow stack stores the
states of the conversation, enabling the bot to keep track of where in the flow
it currently is. The flow stack is stored in the `flow_stack` slot.

Let's take the following example flow and a conversation that is currently
using it:
```yaml title="flows.yml"
flows:
  transfer_money:
    description: This flow let's users send money to friends and family.

    steps:
      - id: "start"
        intent: transfer_money
        next: "ask_recipient"
      - id: "ask_recipient"
        question: transfer_money_recipient
        next: "ask_amount"
      - id: "ask_amount"
        question: transfer_money_amount_of_money
        next: "check_transfer_funds"
    # - ...
```

<Image
  img={flowStackEvolution}
  caption="Changes to the flow stack during a correction of a prior user input"
  alt=""

The correction *"oh sorry I meant John"* from the user triggers a correction
flow to be started. This **correction is not explicitly modeled** in the 
`transfer_money` flow but rather handled by a so called 
"conversational pattern".

The correction flow is one of these "conversational patterns". It is only 
executed when the user corrects a prior input. When triggered, the 
correction flow is put on top of the flow stack and executed. 

The correction flow is an "interruption" to the `transfer_money` flow. Once the
correction flow is completed, the `transfer_money` flow is resumed. Before, the
`transfer_money` is resumed, the `resume_flow` flow is triggered. It allows the
dialogue designer to define how to guide the user back to the original flow, 
`transfer_money` in this case.

Once the `resume_flow` flow is completed, the `transfer_money` flow is resumed
and the bot is back in the state it was before the correction flow was started.
The `transfer_money` flow will re-ask the question that was interrupted by the
correction flow.

### Transitioning Between States

The FlowPolicy transitions between states in response to user inputs or after an
action has been completed. Initially, it waits for user input. Once received, it
advances the state of the machine until it makes an action prediction. After the
action has been completed and its result incorporated, it continues advancing to
the next state.

### Starting New Flows

Starting a new flow in the FlowPolicy can be done in one of two ways. Either,
by user input that corresponds that matches the first step in a flow or 
by predicting the "flow action".

#### User Input
The user message *"i want to transfer money"* will trigger a flow 
`transfer_money` if this flow is defined to be triggered by this message, e.g.:

```yaml title="flows.yml"

flows:
  transfer_money:
    name: Transfer money
    steps:
      - id: "1"
        intent: transfer_money
        action: action_transfer_money
      - id: "2"
        action: utter_lets_transfer_money
    # - ... 
```

The NLU model will predict the intent `transfer_money` and the FlowPolicy will
start the flow `transfer_money` as a result.

#### Predicting Flow Actions
Another policy can predict the action `flow_transfer_money` and the FlowPolicy
will start the flow `transfer_money` as a result.

### Interruptions and Digressions

Flows and their specification should model the happy path of a conversation.
Digressions and interruptions are not explicitly modeled in the flow. Instead,
the `FlowPolicy` relies on other components to identify these cases and
interrupt the flow. The digressions and interruptions the flow policy is able 
to handle are documented in [Handling Unhappy Paths](./unhappy-paths.mdx).

At times, the user might provide something that the flow does not expect. The
`FlowPolicy` does not identify these cases itself, but relies on other 
components to identify these cases and interrupt the flow. 

For example, the user message *"oh sorry I meant John"* is a correction to a 
prior input. The `FlowPolicy` relies on another component to identify that this
is a corretion and set the corresponding slots. Based on this, the `FlowPolicy`
will then start the correction flow.

## Configuration

Currently, there is no additional configuration required for the FlowPolicy
beyond what has been outlined above.

## FAQ

### Using the FlowPolicy with other Polices
Currently, we recommend to avoid using the `FlowPolicy` together with the 
`RulePolicy`. The `RulePolicy` is not aware of the flow stack and its 
predictions are known to interfere with the `FlowPolicy`.
