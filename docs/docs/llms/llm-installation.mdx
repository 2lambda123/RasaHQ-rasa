    capabilities.

import RasaLabsLabel from "@theme/RasaLabsLabel";

<RasaLabsLabel />

<RasaLabsBanner/>

The next generation of Rasa's dialogue management is currently only 
available as a Rasa Labs release, which is restricted to customers of Rasa.

If you already have a valid Rasa Pro license, you can install Rasa Labs
releases using the installation instructions from the 
[Rasa Pro Python Installation](../installation/rasa-pro/installation.mdx#python-package-installation) guide.

After you've completed the authentication and configuration steps
in the Rasa Pro Installation, you can install the latest Rasa Labs version
using:

```bash
pip install rasa-plus==3.7.0a2
```
