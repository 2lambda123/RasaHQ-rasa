  you'll learn what you need to configure and how you can customize LLMs to work
  efficiently with your specific use case.

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of configuring Rasa to use OpenAI
LLMs, including deployments that rely on the Azure OpenAI service.

:::note

At the moment we are focused on supporting OpenAI LLMs, but we are working to
support other LLMs in the future.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, make sure that you have:

- Access to OpenAI's services
- Ability to generate API keys for OpenAI

## Configuration

Configuring LLMs to work with OpenAI involves several steps. The following
sub-sections outline each of these steps and what you need to do.

### API Token

The API token is a key element that allows your Rasa instance to connect and 
communicate with OpenAI. This needs to be configured correctly to ensure seamless
interaction between the two.

To configure the API token, follow these steps:

1. [Instructions to get your API token]
2. [Instructions to set the token in your LLM configuration]

### Model Configuration

Rasa allow you to use different models for different components. For example,
you might use one model for intent classification and another for rephrasing.

To configure models per component, follow these steps described on the 
pages for each component:

1. [Instructions to configure models for intent classification](./llm-intent)
2. [Instructions to configure models for rephrasing](./llm-nlg)

### Additional Configuration for Azure OpenAI Service

For those using Azure OpenAI Service, there are additional parameters that need
to be configured:

- `openai.api_type`: This should be set to "azure" to indicate the use of Azure
  OpenAI Service.
- `openai.api_base`: This should be the URL for your Azure OpenAI instance. An
  example might look like this: "https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/".
- `openai.api_version`: This should be the version of Azure OpenAI you are
  using, such as "2023-05-15".

To configure these parameters, follow these steps:

1. [Instructions to set `openai.api_type`]
2. [Instructions to set `openai.api_base`]
3. [Instructions to set `openai.api_version`]

## Other LLM providers

We're continually working to support more LLMs in the future. If you have any
specific requests or need assistance with setup, feel free to reach out to us.

Remember, your feedback helps us improve and provide the features and support
you need.
