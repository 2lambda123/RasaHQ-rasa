  Dialogue Management combining LLMs and business logic (Flows).

## Motivation

The approach combine the best of both worlds:

- the flexibility of LLMs and
- the control of business logic.

The idea is to use LLMs to handle unhappy paths and to use business logic to
handle happy paths.

The combination of LLMs and Flows avoids "black box" behavior. This approach
allows to limit the specification of business logic to a minimum and provides
ample opportunity to customize dialogue behavior.

## Approach

- specify happy paths with business logic
- specify patterns of unhappy paths using separate flows
- use flows to keep track of state
- use LLMs to update flow states
