## Flows with Unhappy Paths

A flow represents a specific business function as a directed graph. Depending on
your business logic, these graphs can be purely linear, branch multiple times or
have cycles in certain sections. To limit complexity for flow designers, we let
them focus on implementing simple direct flows or
[happy paths](../glossary.mdx#happy--unhappy-paths), where the user reaches
their initial goal and where these goals are attained step by step.

Instead of having to model flow switches, cancellations, or slot corrections
explicitly, a rasa assistant handles these things in a uniform manner across
flows, greatly reducing the complexity of flow design.

:::info

Rasa comes with a **default implementation for every unhappy path**. You can
override these defaults by defining flows with the respective names shown here.
For example, you can define a flow called `pattern_correction` to override the
default behavior of the bot when a user interrupts a flow.

## Digressions

Digressions happen when the user is currently involved in one flow, e.g.
transferring money to a friend, and they need access to some information, such
as their current balance, before continuing with the flow.

<Chat caption="Digression:">
  <ChatUserText>I want to send some money to Sudarshana</ChatUserText>
  <ChatBotText>How much do you want to send to Sudarshana?</ChatBotText>
  <ChatUserText>Ah wait, how much money do I have, did my paycheck already arrive?</ChatUserText>
  <ChatBotText>You currently have 4021.20$ in your account.</ChatBotText>
  <ChatBotText>Let's continue with sending money to Sudarshana.</ChatBotText>
  <ChatBotText>How much money do you want to send to Sudarshana then?</ChatBotText>
  <ChatUserText>...</ChatUserText>
</Chat>

In the above conversation you can see that

1. The transferring money flow was interrupted by the checking balance flow and
   the needed information was provided
2. The bot commented on returning to the original flow
3. The bot restated the current question of the original flow

This represents the default behavior in flows. You can adjust this behavior by
adapting the preconfigured flow called `pattern_continue_interrupted` which is
defined as follows:

```yaml title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_flow_continue_interrupted:
    - text: Let's continue with the topic {rasa_previous_flow}.
      metadata:
        rephrase: True
```

```yaml title="flows.yml"
flows:
  pattern_continue_interrupted:
    description:
      A meta flow that should be started to continue an interrupted flow.

    steps:
      - id: "0"
        action: utter_flow_continue_interrupted
```

You can override these defaults by defining flows, slots, or responses with the
respective names shown here. For instance, you could either remove the statement
about the interrupted flow being continued or add another confirmation step.

## Corrections

Corrections of slots happen for a variety of reasons. Users might want to
correct their own mistake or a mistake the bot made, or they might change their
minds about certain aspects of what they want to achieve.

<Chat caption="A common correction scenario">
  <ChatUserText>I want to send some money to Joe</ChatUserText>
  <ChatBotText>How much money do you want to send?</ChatBotText>
  <ChatUserText>50$</ChatUserText>
  <ChatBotText>Do you want to send 50$ to Joe? (Yes/No)</ChatBotText>
  <ChatUserText>Oh wait!! I meant to say to John, not to Joe!</ChatUserText>
  <ChatBotText>Do you want to update the recipient to John? (Yes/No)</ChatBotText>
  <ChatUserText>Yes!</ChatUserText>
  <ChatBotText>Updated recipient to John</ChatBotText>
  <ChatBotText>Do you want to send 50$ to John? (Yes/No)</ChatBotText>
  <ChatUserText>...</ChatUserText>
</Chat>

In the above conversation you can see that

1. The bot understands that the user wants to correct a slot that was set
   earlier and asks the user for confirmation before making the change
2. The bot informs the user about the successful change

Under the hood, the flow is replayed in the background starting from the
corrected question to ensure the updated information is still in line with any
logical checks along the flow.

If the change had resulted in going down a different path, the user would see
the questions and utterances of this alternate path.

This represents the default behavior in flows. You can adjust this behavior by
adapting the preconfigured flow called `pattern_correction` which is defined as
follows:

```yaml title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_ask_confirm_correction:
    - text: "Do you want to update your information?"
      buttons:
        - payload: /affirm
          title: Yes
        - payload: /deny
          title: No, please keep the previous information
      metadata:
        rephrase: True
  utter_corrected_previous_input:
    - text: "Ok, I corrected the previous input."
      metadata:
        rephrase: True
  utter_not_corrected_previous_input:
    - text: "Ok, I did not correct the previous input."
      metadata:
        rephrase: True
slots:
  confirm_correction:
    type: text
    mappings:
      - intent: affirm
        type: from_intent
        value: "True"
        conditions:
          - active_loop: question_confirm_correction
      - intent: deny
        type: from_intent
        value: "False"
        conditions:
          - active_loop: question_confirm_correction
```

```yaml title="flows.yml"
flows:
  pattern_correction:
    description:
      A meta flow that should be started to correct a previous user input.

    steps:
      - id: "0"
        question: confirm_correction
        next:
          - if: confirm_correction
            then: "1"
          - else: "2"
      - id: "1"
        action: utter_corrected_previous_input
      - id: "2"
        set_slots:
          - rasa_corrected_slots: None
        next: "3"
      - id: "3"
        action: utter_not_corrected_previous_input
```

You can override these defaults by defining flows, slots, or responses with the
respective names shown here. For instance, you could either remove the
confirmation for correcting slots or disable slots correction altogether.

## Cancellations

Cancellations can happen for a variety of reasons. The user might have changed
their mind on a whim or due to new information learned during the conversation.

<Chat caption="A common cancelation scenario">
  <ChatUserText>I want to send some money to Dimitri</ChatUserText>
  <ChatBotText>How much money do you want to send?</ChatBotText>
  <ChatUserText>Ah, nevermind. I see I have already sent it earlier.</ChatUserText>
  <ChatBotText>Okay, I am cancelling the transfer.</ChatBotText>
  <ChatUserText>...</ChatUserText>
</Chat>


In the above conversation you can see that the bot informed the user about the
cancellation of the flow. This represents the default behavior in flows. You can
adjust this behavior by adapting the preconfigured flow called
`pattern_cancel_flow` which is defined as follows:

```yaml title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_flow_cancelled_rasa:
    - text: Okay, stopping the flow {rasa_cancelled_flow}.
      metadata:
        rephrase: True
```

```yaml title="flows.yml"
flows:
  pattern_cancel_flow:
    description: A meta flow that's started when a flow is cancelled.

    steps:
      - id: "0"
        action: utter_flow_cancelled_rasa
```

You can see that this response is using an extra variable, `rasa_cancelled_flow`
which is filled by the flow policy upon executing the cancel flow pattern.
Currently, you can only change the cancellation message, but not introduce a
confirmation. This is on our todo list.
