title: Custom Graph Components
abstract: You can extend Rasa Open Source with custom NLU components and policies. This page provides a guide on how to develop your own custom graph components.
---

Rasa Open Source provides a variety of [NLU components](components.mdx) and
[policies](policies.mdx) out of the box. You can customize them or create your
own components from scratch by using custom graph components.

To use your custom graph component with Rasa Open Source it has to fulfill the following
requirements:
- It has to implement the [`GraphComponent` interface](#the-graphcomponent-interface)
- It has to be [registered](#registering-graph-components-with-the-model-configuration)
  with the used model configuration
- It has to be used in the [configuration file](#using-custom-components-in-your-model-configuration)
- It has to use type annotations. Rasa Open Source makes use of the type annotations
  to validate your model configuration.
  [Forward references](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#forward-references)
  are not allowed. If you're using Python 3.7 you can use
  [`from __future__ import annotations`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/#enabling-the-future-behavior-in-python-3-7)
  to get rid of forward references.


## Graph Components

Rasa Open Source uses the passed in [model configuration](model-configuration.mdx) to build a
[directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).
This graph describes the dependencies between the items in your model configuration and
how data flows between them. This has two major benefits:

- Rasa Open Source can use the computational graph to optimize the execution of your
  model. Examples for this are efficient caching of training steps or executing
  independent steps in parallel.
- Rasa Open Source can represent different model architectures flexibly. As long as the
  graph remains acyclic Rasa Open Source can in theory pass any data to any graph
  component based on the model configuration without having to tie the underlying
  software architecture to the used model architecture.

When translating the model configuration to the computational graph
[policies](policies.mdx) and [NLU components](components.mdx) become nodes within this graph.
While there is a distinction between policies and NLU components in your model
configuration the distinction is abstracted away when they are placed within the graph.
At this point policies and NLU components become abstract *graph components*.
In practice this is represented by the
[`GraphComponent`](custom-graph-components.mdx#the-graphcomponent-interface)
interface: Both policies and NLU components have to inherit from this interface to
become compatible and executable for Rasa's graph.

## Getting Started
Before you get started you have to decide whether you want to implement a custom
[NLU component](components.mdx) or a [policy](policies.mdx). If you are implementing
a custom policy then we recommend extending the existing
`rasa.core.policies.policy.Policy` class.

```python
from rasa.core.policies.policy import Policy

# TODO: Correctly register your graph component
@DefaultV1Recipe.register(
    [DefaultV1Recipe.ComponentType.POLICY_WITHOUT_END_TO_END_SUPPORT], is_trainable=True
)
class MyPolicy(Policy):
    ...
```

If you want to implement a custom NLU component then start out with the following
skeleton:

```python (docs/sources/data/test_classes/nlu_component_skeleton.py)
```
:::note custom tokenizers
If you create a custom tokenizer you should implement the methods of
`rasa.nlu.tokenizers.tokenizer.Tokenizer`. The `train` and `process` methods are
already implemented so you only need to overwrite the `tokenize` method.

:::



## The `GraphComponent` interface
To run your custom NLU component or policy with Rasa Open Source it has
to implement the `GraphComponent` interface.

```python (docs/sources/data/test_classes/graph_component_interface.py)
```

### `create`
The `create` method is used to instantiate your graph component during training and has to be
overridden. Rasa Open Source passes the following parameters when calling the method:

- `config`: This is your model's default configuration merged with the
   configuration provided to the graph component in the model configuration file.
- `model_storage`: You can use this to persist and load your graph components. See
   [model persistence](#model-persistence) section for further details on its usage.
- `resource`: This uniquely identifies your component within the `model_storage`.
   See the [model persistence](#model-persistence) section for further
   details on its usage.
- `execution_context`: This provides additional information about the current
   mode of execution:
   - `model_id`: A unique identifier for the model used during inference. This
      parameter is `None` during training.
   - `should_add_diagnostic_data`: If `True` then additional diagnostic metadata
      can be added to your graph component's predictions on top of the actual prediction.
   - `is_finetuning`: If `True` then the graph component is trained using
     [finetuning](command-line-interface.mdx#incremental-training).
   - `graph_schema`: The `graph_schema` describes the computational graph which is used
     to train your assistant or to make predictions with it.
   - `node_name`: The `node_name` is a unique identifier for the step in the graph
     schema which is fulfilled by the called graph component

### `load`
The `load` method is used to instantiate your graph component during inference. The default
implementation of this method calls your `create` method. It is recommended to override
this if your graph component
[persists data as part of the training](#model-persistence).
See [`create`](#create) for a description of the single parameters.

### `get_default_config`
The method `get_default_config` returns the default configuration for your graph
component. Its default implementation returns an empty dictionary which implies that
the graph component
does not have any configuration. Rasa Open Source will update the configuration given
in the configuration file with the default configuration during runtime.

### `supported_languages`
The method `supported_languages` specifies which languages a graph component supports.
Rasa Open Source will use the `language` key in the model configuration file to
validate that the graph component is valid for usage with the specified language.
If a graph component returns `None` (this is the default implementation), it indicates
that the graph component supports all languages which are not part of
`not_supported_languages`.

   Examples:
   - `[]`: The graph component does not support any language
   - `None`: All languages are supported expect the languages defined in
     `not_supported_languages`
   - `["en"]`: The graph component can only be used with English conversations.

### `not_supported_languages`
The method `not_supported_languages` specifies which languages your
graph component does not support. Rasa Open Source will use the `language` key in the
model configuration file to validate that your graph component is valid for usage with
the specified language. If your graph component returns `None` (this is the default
implementation), you indicate that it supports all languages which are specified in
`supported_languages`.

   Examples:
   - `None` or `[]`: All languages specified in `supported_languages` are supported.
   - `["en"]`: The graph component can be used with any language except English.

### `required_packages`
The `required_packages` method indicates which Python packages need to
be installed to be able to use this graph component. Rasa Open Source will raise an error
during execution if your graoh component is used without the required libraries being
installed. By default, this method returns an empty list which implies that your graph
component does not have any extra dependencies.

Examples:
- `[]`: No extra packages are required to use this graph component
- `["spacy"]`: The Python package `spacy` needs to be installed to be able to run
  this graph component.

## Model Persistence
Some graph components require persisting data during training which should be available
to the graph component during inference time. A typical use case for this is storing model
weights. Rasa Open Source provides the
`model_storage` and `resource` parameters to your graph component's `create` and `load`
method for this purpose as shown in the snippet below. The `model_storage` provides
access to data from all graph components. The `resource` allows you to uniquely identify
your graph component's location in the model storage.


```python {6,7,16,17}
class MyComponent(GraphComponent):
    @classmethod
    def create(
        cls,
        config: Dict[Text, Any],
        model_storage: ModelStorage,
        resource: Resource,
        execution_context: ExecutionContext,
    ) -> MyComponent:
        ...

    @classmethod
    def create(
        cls,
        config: Dict[Text, Any],
        model_storage: ModelStorage,
        resource: Resource,
        execution_context: ExecutionContext,
        **kwargs: Any
    ) -> MyComponent:
        ...
```

### Writing to the Model Storage

The snippet below illustrates how to write your graph component's data to the model
storage.
It is recommended to store `model_storage` and `resource` at initialization time and
then use them at the end of your component's `train` method to handle the persistence
of your graph component.

The `self._model_storage.write_to(self._resource)` context manager provides a path to
a directory where you can persist any data required by your
graph component. Note that it is required to return your graph component's `resource`
at the end of your graph component's `train` method so that Rasa Open Source can cache
the training results between trainings.

```python
class MyComponent(GraphComponent):

    def __init__(
        self,
        model_storage: ModelStorage,
        resource: Resource,
        training_artifact: Optional[Dict],
    ) -> None:
        # Store both `model_storage` and `resource` as object attributes to be able
        # to utilize them at the end of the training
        self._model_storage = model_storage
        self._resource = resource

    @classmethod
    def create(
        cls,
        config: Dict[Text, Any],
        model_storage: ModelStorage,
        resource: Resource,
        execution_context: ExecutionContext,
    ) -> MyComponent:
        return cls(model_storage, resource, training_artifact=None)

    def train(self, training_data: TrainingData) -> Resource:
        # Train your graph component
        ...

        # Persist your graph component
        with self._model_storage.write_to(self._resource) as directory_path:
            with open(directory_path / "artifact.json", "w") as file:
                json.dump({"my": "training artifact"}, file)

        # Return resource to make sure the training artifacts
        # can be cached.
        return self._resource

```

### Reading from the Model Storage

When Rasa Open Source calls `load` to instantiate your graph component for
inference you can use the counterpart `self._model_storage.read_from(resource)` to
get access to the same directory. Using the provided path you can then load the
persisted data and initialize your graph component with it. Note that the `model_storage`
will throw a `ValueError` in case no persisted data was found for the given `resource`.

```python
class MyComponent(GraphComponent):

    def __init__(
        self,
        model_storage: ModelStorage,
        resource: Resource,
        training_artifact: Optional[Dict],
    ) -> None:
        self._model_storage = model_storage
        self._resource = resource

    @classmethod
    def load(
        cls,
        config: Dict[Text, Any],
        model_storage: ModelStorage,
        resource: Resource,
        execution_context: ExecutionContext,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> MyComponent:
        try:
            with model_storage.read_from(resource) as directory_path:
                with open(directory_path / "artifact.json", "r") as file:
                    training_artifact = json.load(file)
                    return cls(
                        model_storage, resource, training_artifact=training_artifact
                    )
        except ValueError:
            # This allows you to handle the case if there was no
            # persisted data for your component
            ...
```


## Registering Graph Components with the Model Configuration
To make your graph component available to Rasa Open Source you have to register your
graph component
with the model configuration. This is done with the `DefaultV1Recipe.register`
decorator:

```python (docs/sources/data/test_classes/registered_component.py) {5-9}
```

Rasa Open Source uses the information provided in the `register` decorator and the
position of your graph component within the configuration file to schedule the execution
of your graph component with its required data. The `DefaultV1Recipe.register` allows you
to specify the following details:

- `component_types`: This specifies what purpose your graph component fulfills within the
   assistant. It is possible to specify multiple types (e.g. if your graph component is both
   intent classifier and entity extractor):
   * `ComponentType.MODEL_LOADER`: Component type for
      [language models](components.mdx#language-models). Graph components of this type provide
      pretrained models to other graph components' `train`, `process_training_data` and
      `process` methods if they have specified `model_from=<model loader name>`.
      This graph component is run during training and
      inference. Rasa Open Source will use the graph component's `provide` method to
      retrieve the model which should be provided to dependent graph components.

   * `ComponentType.MESSAGE_TOKENIZER`: Component type for
      [tokenizers](components.mdx#tokenizers). This graph component is run during training and
      inference. Rasa Open Source will use the graph component's `train` method if
      `is_trainable=True` is specified. Rasa Open Source will use
      `process_training_data` for tokenizing training data examples and `process`
      to tokenize messages during inference.

   * `ComponentType.MESSAGE_FEATURIZER`: Component type for
      [featurizers](components.mdx#featurizers). This graph component is run during training and
      inference. Rasa Open Source will use the graph component's `train` method if
      `is_trainable=True` is specified. Rasa Open Source will use
      `process_training_data` for featurizing training data examples and `process`
      to featurize messages during inference.

   * `ComponentType.INTENT_CLASSIFIER`: Component type for
      [intent classifiers](components.mdx#intent-classifiers). This graph component is run only
      during training if `is_trainable=True`. The graph component is always run during
      inference.
      Rasa Open Source will use the graph component's `train` method if
      `is_trainable=True` is specified. Rasa Open Source will use
      the graph component's `process` method to classify the intent of messages during
      inference.

   * `ComponentType.ENTITY_EXTRACTOR`: Component type for
      [entity extractors](components.mdx#entity-extractors). This graph component is run only
      during training if `is_trainable=True`. The graph component is always run during
      inference.
      Rasa Open Source will use the graph component's `train` method if
      `is_trainable=True` is specified. Rasa Open Source will use
      the graph scomponent's `process` method to extract entities during inference.

   * `ComponentType.POLICY_WITHOUT_END_TO_END_SUPPORT`: Component type for
      [policies](policies.mdx) which don't require additional end-to-end features
      (see [end-to-end training](stories.mdx#end-to-end-training) for more information).
      This graph component is run only during training if `is_trainable=True`.
      The graph component is always run during inference.
      Rasa Open Source will use the graph component's `train` method if
      `is_trainable=True` is specified. Rasa Open Source will use
      the graph component's `predict_action_probabilities` to make predictions for the
      next action which should be run within a conversation.

   * `ComponentType.POLICY_WITH_END_TO_END_SUPPORT`: Component type for
      [policies](policies.mdx) which require additional end-to-end features
      (see [end-to-end training](stories.mdx#end-to-end-training) for more information).
      The end-to-end features are passed into the graph component's `train` and
      `predict_action_probabilities` as `precomputations` parameter.
      This graph component is run only during training if `is_trainable=True`.
      The graph component is always run during inference.
      Rasa Open Source will use the graph component's `train` method if
      `is_trainable=True` is specified. Rasa Open Source will use
      the graph component's `predict_action_probabilities` to make predictions for the
      next action which should be run within a conversation.

- `is_trainable`: Specifies if the graph component requires to train itself before it can
   process training data for other dependent graph components or before it can make
   predictions

- `model_from`: Specifies if a pretrained model needs to be provided to the `train`,
  `process_training_data` and `process` methods of the graph component. Note that you
   still need to make sure that the model provided graph component is part of your model
   configuration.

## Using Custom Components in your Model Configuration
You can use custom components like any other NLU component or policy within your
[model configuration](model-configuration.mdx). The only change is that you have to specify
the full module name instead of the class name only. The full module name depends on
your module's location in relation to the specified
[PYTHONPATH](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH).
By default, Rasa Open Source adds the directory from where you run the CLI to the
`PYTHONPATH`. If you e.g. run the CLI from `/Users/<user>/my-rasa-project`
and your module `MyComponent` is in `/Users/<user>/my-rasa-project/custom_components/my_component.py`
then the module path is `custom_components.my_component.MyComponent`. Everything except
the `name` entry will be passed as `config` to your component.

```yaml-rasa {5-6,10} title="config.yml"
recipe: default.v1
language: en
pipeline:
# other NLU components
- name: your.custom.NLUComponent
  dimensions: ["number"]

policies:
# other dialogue policies
- name: your.custom.Policy
```

## Implementation Hints

### Message Metadata
When you [define metadata for your intent examples in your training data](./training-data-format.mdx#training-examples),
your NLU component can access both the intent metadata and the intent example metadata during processing:

```python
# in your component class

    def process(self, message: Message, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        metadata = message.get("metadata")
        print(metadata.get("intent"))
        print(metadata.get("example"))
```

### Sparse and Dense Message Features
If you create a custom message featurizer you can return two different kind of features: sequence features and sentence
features. The sequence features are a matrix of size `(number-of-tokens x feature-dimension)`, e.g.
the matrix contains a feature vector for every token in the sequence.
The sentence features are represented by a matrix of size `(1 x feature-dimension)`.
