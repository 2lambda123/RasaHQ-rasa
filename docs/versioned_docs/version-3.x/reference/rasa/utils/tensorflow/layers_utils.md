#### random\_indices

```python
def random_indices(batch_size: Union[Tensor, int], n: Union[Tensor, int],
                   n_max: Union[Tensor, int]) -> Tensor
```

Creates `batch_size * n` random indices that run from `0` to `n_max`.

**Arguments**:

- `batch_size` - Number of items in each batch
- `n` - Number of random indices in each example
- `n_max` - Maximum index (excluded)
  

**Returns**:

  A uniformly distributed integer tensor of indices

#### batch\_flatten

```python
def batch_flatten(x: Tensor) -> Tensor
```

Flattens all but last dimension of `x` so it becomes 2D.

**Arguments**:

- `x` - Any tensor with at least 2 dimensions
  

**Returns**:

  The reshaped tensor, where all but the last dimension
  are flattened into the first dimension

#### get\_candidate\_values

```python
def get_candidate_values(x: tf.Tensor, candidate_ids: tf.Tensor) -> tf.Tensor
```

Gathers candidate values according to IDs.

**Arguments**:

- `x` - Any tensor with at least one dimension
- `candidate_ids` - Indicator for which candidates to gather
  

**Returns**:

  A tensor of shape `(batch_size, 1, num_candidates, tf.shape(x)[-1])`, where
  for each batch example, we generate a list of `num_candidates` vectors, and
  each candidate is chosen from `x` according to the candidate id. For example:
  
  ```
  x = [[0 1 2],
  [3 4 5],
  [6 7 8]]
  candidate_ids = [[0, 1], [0, 0], [2, 0]]
  gives
  [
  [[0 1 2],
  [3 4 5]],
  [[0 1 2],
  [0 1 2]],
  [[6 7 8],
  [0 1 2]]
  ]
  ```

#### reduce\_mean\_equal

```python
def reduce_mean_equal(x: tf.Tensor,
                      y: tf.Tensor,
                      mask: Optional[tf.Tensor] = None) -> tf.Tensor
```

Computes the mean number of matches between x and y.

If `x` and `y` have `n` dimensions, then the mean equal
number of indices is calculated for the last dimension by
only taking the valid indices into consideration
(from the mask) and then it is averaged over all
other `n-1` dimensions.

For e.g., if:

x = [[1,2,3,4]
[5,6,7,8]]
y = [[1,2,3,4]
[5,6,0,0]]
mask = [[1,1,1,1],
[1,1,1,0]]

then the output will be calculated as `((4/4) + 2/3) / 2`

**Arguments**:

- `x` - Any numeric tensor.
- `y` - Another tensor with same shape and type as x.
- `mask` - Tensor with a mask to distinguish actual indices from padding indices.
  Shape should be the same as `x` and `y`.
  

**Returns**:

  The mean of &quot;x == y&quot;
