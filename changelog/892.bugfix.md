Improvements and fixes to cleaning up commands:

- Clean up predicted `StartFlow` commands from the `LLMCommandGenerator` if the flow, that should
be started, is already active.
- Clean up predicted SetSlot commands from the `LLMCommandGenerator` if the value of the slot is
already set on the tracker.
- Use string comparison for slot values to make sure to capture cases when the `LLMCommandGenerator`
predicted a string value but the value set on the tracker is, for example, an integer value.
