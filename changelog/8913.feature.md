Introduces a new policy called [`IntentTEDPolicy`](./policies.mdx#intent-ted-policy).

`IntentTEDPolicy` helps you [review conversations](./conversation-driven-development.mdx#review)
 and also allows your bot to react to unexpected user turns in conversations.
 It is an auxiliary policy that should only be used in conjunction with
 at least one other policy, as the only action that it can trigger
 is the special and newly introduced
 [`action_unlikely_intent`](./default-actions.mdx#action_unlikely_intent) action.

 The auto-configuration will include `IntentTEDPolicy` in your
 configuration automatically, but you can also include it yourself
 in the `policies` section of the configuration:

 ```
 policies:
   - name: IntentTEDPolicy
     epochs: 200
     max_history: 5
 ```

As part of the feature, it also introduces:

- [`IntentMaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer`](./policies.mdx#3-intent-max-history)
  to featurize the trackers for `IntentTEDPolicy`.
- `MultiLabelDotProductLoss` to support `IntentTEDPolicy`'s multi-label training objective.
- A new default action called [`action_unlikely_intent`](./default-actions.mdx#action_unlikely_intent).


`rasa test` command has also been adapted to `IntentTEDPolicy`:

- if a test story contains `action_unlikely_intent` and the policy ensemble does not trigger it, this leads to
  a test error (wrongly predicted action)
- if the story does not contain `action_unlikely_intent` and Rasa Open Source does predict it then
  the prediction of `action_unlikely_intent` will be ignored for the evaluation (and hence not lead
  to a wrong prediction) but the story will be logged in a file called `stories_with_warnings.yml`


`rasa data validate` command should warn if `action_unlikely_intent` is
included in the training stories.
