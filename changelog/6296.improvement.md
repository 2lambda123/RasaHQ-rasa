* Modified functionality of ``SingleStateFeaturizer`` 

``SingleStateFeaturizer`` uses trained NLU ``Interpreter`` to featurize intents and action name. This modified ``SingleStateFeaturizer`` can replicate ``LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer`` functionality. This component is deprecated from now on. 
To replicate ``LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer`` functionality, add a ``Tokenizer`` and ``CountVectorsFeaturizer`` to the NLU ``pipeline``. Please update your configuration file. 

The new ``SingleStateFeaturizer`` stores slots, entities and forms in sparse features for more lightweight storage. 

* Modified ``TEDPolicy`` to handle sparse features;

As a result, ``TEDPolicy`` may require more epochs, than before, to converge.
