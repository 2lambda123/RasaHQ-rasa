Improved handling of categorical slots with text values when using CALM.

Slot values extracted by the command generator (LLM) will be stored in the
same casing as the casing used to define the categorical slot values in the
domain. E.g. A categorical slot defined to store the values ["A", "B"]
will store "A" if the LLM predicts the slot to be filled with "a". Previously,
this would have stored "a".
