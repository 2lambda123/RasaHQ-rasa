Update the CALM starter template by:
- adding the following flows from the financial chatbot:
  - add_contact.yml
  - remove_contact.yml
  - list_contacts.yml
- using multiple modules (in the form of yml files) to segregate the flows (a good model to be followed)
- adding e2e tests:
  - happy paths
  - cancelations
  - corrections
