Allow multiple entities to be annotated for the same word/tokens.  
When using entity extractors that support generating multiple entities from a single expression, the test stories fail as there is no way to annotate multiple entity_types and entity_values.
Entity Extractors like DIET are not optimized for training with multiple entity extractions, so be sure to use only Regex or FlashText or similar extractors.  
New annotation option is  
```YAML
stories:
  - story: Some story
    steps:
      - user: |
          I would like to cancel my contarct for my [iphone][{"entity":"iphone", "value":"iphone"},{"entity":"smartphone", "value":"true"}{"entity":"mobile_service", "value":"true"}] 
        intent: cancel_contract
```
