1. Modified _training_payload_from_yaml() to seperate request payload into files with standard architecture in the temp folder.

    [ Temp Folder Structure ]

    \+ data/nlu.yml

    \+ data/rules.yml

    \+ data/ stories.yml

    \+ domain.yml

    \+ config.yml

    (other files for other processes)

2. Update new valid request payload sample for the API "model/train" into the document.

Description

In origin _training_payload_from_yaml(), it placed the request payload into the "single" file which caused the process of juding whether to retrain with wrong judgement.
