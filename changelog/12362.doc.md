Updated [knowledge base action docs](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/main/docs/docs/action-server/knowledge-base-actions.mdx) to include improvements related to the direct extraction of object types from user requests. This enhancement enables users to inquire objects without needing to list objects of an object type beforehand when utilizing knowledge base actions.
