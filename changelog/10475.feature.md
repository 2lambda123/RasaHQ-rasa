Introduces EntityHierarchyExtractor to the suite of entity extractors.

EntityHierarchyExtractor is an entity extractor that bases entity extraction on 
hierarchical structures. Any keyword defined in the hierarchy will trigger all entities above.
The idea is based on [ontology relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology#Properties_and_relations), but kept restricted to be easy to define and maintain.
