In Rasa Open Source 3.0, we shipped Markers as an experimental feature. Since then, we discovered
new requirements that made us rethink our approach. We will ship an evolution of Markers as part
of the upcoming release(s) of Rasa Pro. Please reach out if you were using Markers with your production
assistant, we're keen to engage with you!
