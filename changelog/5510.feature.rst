You can now define what kind of features should be used by what component.

You can set an alias for every featurizer in your pipeline.
You can then specify on, for example, the :ref:`diet-classifier` what features from which featurizers should go in.
If you don't set the option ``featurizers`` all available features will be used.
This is also the default behaviour.

Here is an example pipeline that shows the new option:

.. code-block::
    pipeline:
    - name: ConveRTTokenizer
    - name: ConveRTFeaturizer
      alias: "convert"
    - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
      alias: "cvf_word"
    - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
      alias: "cvf_char"
      analyzer: char_wb
      min_ngram: 1
      max_ngram: 4
    - name: RegexFeaturizer
      alias: "regex"
    - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
      alias: "lsf"
    - name: DIETClassifier:
      featurizers: ["convert", "cvf_word", "cvf_char", "regex", "lsf"]
    - name: ResponseSelector
      epochs: 50
      featurizers: ["convert", "cvf_word"]
    - name: EntitySynonymMapper
