You can now define what kind of features should be used by what component (see :ref:`choosing-a-pipeline`).

You can set an alias via the option ``alias`` for every featurizer in your pipeline.
You can then specify, for example, on the :ref:`diet-classifier` what features from which featurizers should be used.
If you don't set the option ``featurizers`` all available features will be used.
This is also the default behaviour.
Check :ref:`components` to see what components have the option ``featurizers`` available.

Here is an example pipeline that shows the new option:

.. code-block::
    pipeline:
    - name: ConveRTTokenizer
    - name: ConveRTFeaturizer
      alias: "convert"
    - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
      alias: "cvf_word"
    - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
      alias: "cvf_char"
      analyzer: char_wb
      min_ngram: 1
      max_ngram: 4
    - name: RegexFeaturizer
      alias: "regex"
    - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
      alias: "lsf"
    - name: DIETClassifier:
      featurizers: ["convert", "cvf_word", "cvf_char", "regex", "lsf"]
    - name: ResponseSelector
      epochs: 50
      featurizers: ["convert", "cvf_word"]
    - name: EntitySynonymMapper
