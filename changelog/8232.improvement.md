New sparse features are added dynamically during incremental training.

In other words, we won't create an extra buffer in advance for additional vocabulary items,
but will dynamically allocate space for them when we actually need it.
This means there's no need to specify `additional_vocabulary_size` for `CountVectorsFeaturizer` or
`number_additional_patterns` for `RegexFeaturizer`.

**Before**
```yaml
pipeline:
  - name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  - name: "RegexFeaturizer"
    number_additional_patterns: 100
  - name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
    additional_vocabulary_size: {text: 100, response: 20}
```
**Now**
```yaml
pipeline:
  - name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  - name: "RegexFeaturizer"
  - name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
```
