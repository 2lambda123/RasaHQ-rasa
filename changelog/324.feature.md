Introduces a **semantic retrieval of the flows** that are relevant to the current state of the conversation, utilizing
similarity between vector embeddings. It enables the assistant to manage and scale to a large number of flows.

Flow retrieval is **enabled by default**. To configure it, you can modify the settings under the `flow_retrieval` 
property of `LLMCommandGenerator` component. For detailed configuration options, refer to our
[documentation](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/dialogue-understanding#customizing-flow-retrieval).

Introduces `always_include_in_prompt` field to the 
[flow definition](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/flows/#flow-properties).
If field is set to `true` and the [flow guard](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/starting-flows/#flow-guards)
defined in the `if` field evaluates to `true`, the flow will be included in the prompt.
