Make TED an end-to-end policy. Namely, make it possible to train TED on stories that contain
intent and entities or user text and bot actions or bot text.
Add possibility to predict entities using TED.

Here's an example of a dialogue in the Rasa story format:

```
stories:
- story: collect restaurant booking info  # name of the story - just for debugging
  steps:
  - intent: greet                          # user message with no entities
  - action: utter_ask_howcanhelp           # action that the bot should execute
  - intent: inform                         # user message with entities
    entities:
    - location: "rome"
    - price: "cheap"
  - bot: On it                             # actual text that bot can output
  - action: utter_ask_cuisine
  - user: I would like [spanish](cuisine). # actual text that user input
  - action: utter_ask_num_people
```
