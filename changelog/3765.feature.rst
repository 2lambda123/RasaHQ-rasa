Add support for composite entities in Rasa NLU.

Composite entities allow you to define a role and/or group label in addition to the entity type.
For more details see :ref:`composite-entities`.

To fill slots from entities with a specific role/group, you need to either use forms or use a custom action.
We updated the tracker method ``get_latest_entity_values`` to take an optional role/group label.
If you want to use a form, you can add the specific role/group label of interest to the slot mapping function
``from_entity`` (see :ref:`forms``).

.. note::

    Composite entities are currently just supported by the ``DIETClassifier``.
