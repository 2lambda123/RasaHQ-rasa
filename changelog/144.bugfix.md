Fix reported issue, e.g. https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/issues/5461 in Rasa Pro:
Do not unpack json payload if `data` key is not present in the response custom output payloads when using socketio channel.
This allows assistants which use custom output payloads to work with the Rasa Inspector debugging tool.
