In ``SQLTrackerStore`` and ``MongoTrackerStore``, events to be saved in addition to
the ones already stored were determined wrongly based on the last ``session_started``
event. This led to the number of events to be stored to be off by one, leading to the
first ``action_listen`` being saved twice in these tracker stores. Determining which
events should be saved now happens based on the timestamp of the latest event stored
in the database.
