Improvements around default behaviour of `ChitChatAnswerCommand()`:
- The command processor will issue `CannotHandleCommand()` instead of the `ChitChatCommand()` when `pattern_chitchat` uses
an action step `action_trigger_chitchat` without the `IntentlessPolicy` being configured. During training a warning is
raised.
- Changed the default pattern_chitchat to:
```yaml
pattern_chitchat:
  description: handle interactions with the user that are not task-oriented
  name: pattern chitchat
  steps:
    - action: action_trigger_chitchat
```
- Default rasa init template for CALM comes with `IntentlessPolicy` added to pipeline.
